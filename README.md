# Testing and Are.na <-> Raycast Integration

An unfinished draft for a @raycast extension. 

- API docs from Are.na are sometimes outdated, browsing through discord helps a ton.
- Image upload without URL needs to spin it's own s3 image upload, https://github.com/tttimur/s3-arena/tree/master could be a good reference.
- Are.na js wrapper is great. Had to create a fork for a small fix.

Known issues:
- Pagination
- Load times
- Refresh grid after add submission
