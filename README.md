# Testing and Are.na <-> Raycast Integration

An unfinished draft for a @raycast extension. If there's anything worthwhile here, in between all the spaghetti code, feel free to use it.

- API docs from Are.na are sometimes outdated, browsing through discord helps a ton
- Image upload without URL needs to spin it's own s3 image upload
- Are.na js wrapper is great
- There are several types of blocks, for text blocks to render similar to are.na and circunvemnt raycast's "UI" the idea was to generate an SVG with the text inside
